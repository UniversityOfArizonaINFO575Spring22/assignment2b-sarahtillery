            <p>
                My undergraduate degree was in Narrative Studies, similar to Creative Writing and English literature, but encompassing study in all narrative and media forms, and how all those forms relate and differ from one another in how they manage to tell stories. It developed in me a passion for multimedia and encouraging media literacy, a topic that I feel is still not covered to the extent it could be in our education system. In the course of my Graduate education, I have discovered an equal passion for Young Adult librarianship, and have developed programming, lesson plans, and activities for mainly young adults, but also children and adults as well, related to fostering a love of reading that acknowledges that many forms of media can relate to that love of reading and media literacy.</p>
            <p>In my Young Adult Librarian and Public Libraries class, LIS 582, for the final project, I proposed the “All Reading is Reading” Summer Reading program. The program would be based on a deep understanding of multimodal learning, which teaches an overall media comprehension that covers art literacy, film studies, and even advertising literacy into the fold of reading comprehension. The goal of this summer reading program would be to reward teens for all that they engaged with over the summer, so long as they can find the connections between what they did and what they read. For instance, if they played Minecraft, and gardened, and then read a book like The Martian (or any science fiction book that features terraforming), they would be encouraged to fill out their summer reading form, create a poster, or a social media post (the initial proposal focused a lot on TikTok) connecting the through lines between those three things. The hope for the program was to help with students who struggle with reading during the school year, and help showcase that reading is just another form of information and media consumption, rather than a chore for school, and that there are so many various things to read, there will certainly be books that align with their interests. As my personal interests lie in comics, the majority of the suggestions in the proposal were comics related, as was the majority of the research referenced, but the program can easily be adapted to include a variety of interests (film, animation, anime, engineering, etc.) The program would be hosted over the summer, with both in-person and online versions to account for all patron needs, and end with an end of summer survey to assess the success of the “All Reading is Reading” program, and see what could be improved the next year.</p>
    <p>This is the project that I think helped guide the rest of my graduate study, my guiding light. There are areas of improvement, of course, but I think that the research and purpose of the program is very solid, and could apply at public libraries, schools, and museums (or even be a collaboration between two or more such institutions) very easily, and be adapted to whatever the specific needs of the community served are without much difficulty.</p><br />

<div class="large-column float-right">
            <p>Extending from the “All Reading is Reading” Summer Reading program, in my Learning Design course, LIS 586, I designed a class and introductory class module for an English/Literature High School class based around multimodal learning. Emphasizing the importance of English class as a place where students do not just read classics, but also develop critical thinking, written and oral communication skills, empathy and emotional intelligence, analytical and creative skills, and general reading comprehension skills, I expanded to include that today’s world is a multimedia world. General reading comprehension and critical thinking is valuable, and can help navigate a multimedia world, but too many students struggle in English class and get left behind. Broadening the scope of a typical English class to a multimodal learning focus encompassing advertising, film and television, comics and cartoons, art history and art theory, and literature helps show that these topics are not separate, but influence one another and tie together in our cultural understanding. Not only that, but it may help students connect better with the material. Students with dyslexia or other disabilities that make sitting down and reading more difficult will have the opportunity to apply the skillsets from English class to other mediums. Students who simply haven’t been able to connect to the materials will find new avenues of connection by connecting materials they do enjoy to required reading.</p>
    <p>Much of this was achieved through major projects that would be conducted throughout the class. These projects would be very open ended and conversational for the most part, while also still teaching the important life skills that are covered in the typical high school English class (such as Compare and Contrast essays, analytical essays, argumentative essays, public speaking), but would allow the students to pick and choose the materials that they want to analyze. With the class giving them the skills they need, students are encouraged to go out and find materials that they really want to engage with, and bring those back to the major projects, and apply what they have learned.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my Learning Design course, I was given excellent feedback on this concept, and fine tuned and adjusted it as necessary, but also came to understand that such a course cannot be perfected without trial and error. There’s a few things I would revisit and change depending on the makeup of a particular class or the context in which it would be taught, but the general learning goals and objectives from the course are still strong enough to hold out through those improvisational changes that may come as the document grows over time.</p>

            <p>Goals<br />
                Having extensive experience working with children and teens, and working as a freelance artist within the retail, comics, and cartoon world, and now the skills to bring that into librarianship, I feel that my ultimate goal as a professional is marry those worlds together either at a Museum or a Public Library, but there are many ways I could do this work independently as well. This is a niche goal, but I believe there are many different directions in which I can cultivate myself as a Comics Librarian. Alternatively, I absolutely can take the enthusiasm, imagination, and energy with which I have explored the concept of Comics Librarianship into my future career wherever it leads me.</p>

        <div class="medium-column float-right">
            <p>Current Work<br /> I have also discovered that many of the skills that I have developed in my graduate studies, and talked about here, have been incredibly useful in the non-profit sector. During the course of my internship, I have been able to utilize much of what I hope to do in my future with the Drag Queen Story Hour, helping in small ways to facilitate programming development, curriculum development, making graphics for social media outreach and activity sheets for story times, researching books for future story times and researching supportive materials for parent education on the benefits of Drag Queen Story Hour. My supervisors were incredibly excited about the prospect of introducing more comics to the mix as well, and my knowledge and background in comics helped introduce a little more into the circulation of materials they hoped to use. While I did not have the time within my internship to do so, I hope in the future we may collaborate further as the DQSH intends to expand into middle grade materials and young adult materials, especially into comics further and further.</p>
